# Zero-Lie Relay Resurrection for AI that can't afford lies. On a $500 laptop, we hit 10 billion inputs/sec-zero hallucinations, zero corruption, zero compromise. This isn't checksum. It's resurrection. What it does - Catches bit-flips (cosmic rays, noise, hallucinations) in under 0.003 seconds - Rebuilds truth using longitudinal XOR tiling - Scales to 10B ops/sec-no GPU, no cluster, no magic - Built for Starship, Neuralink, Colossus. Runs anywhere. Proof - Started at 600 ops/sec - Ended at 48 million (Grok X) - My run: 10 billion, full telemetry, full noise Hardware: Asus FX507ZC4 (i5-12500, 32GB DDR4) - no accelerators. Files - resurrect_loop.py - full Numba code, prange, tile_checksum - benchmarks.md - step-by-step run log - diagram.txt - ASCII resurrection path License? Open for forks. But truth isn't free. If you run it in production, send a check. You know who to send it to. Drop the whitepaper tonight. This isn't open source. This is open proof. #SupermanRelay #TruthWins Whitepaper:  once it's live.
